# **[Evaluation of Production Serverless Computing Environments](http://dsc.soic.indiana.edu/publications/Evaluation_of_Production_Serverless_Computing_Environments.pdf)**

## Abstract
Serverless computing provides a small runtime container to execute lines of codes without infrastructure management which is similar to Platform as a Service (PaaS) but a functional level. Amazon started the event-driven compute named Lambda functions in 2014 with a 25 concurrent limitation, but it now supports at least a thousand of concurrent invocation to process event messages generated by resources like databases, storage and system logs. Other providers, i.e., Google, Microsoft, and IBM offer a dynamic scaling manager to handle parallel requests of stateless functions in which additional containers are provisioning on new compute nodes for distribution. However, while functions are often developed for microservices and lightweight workload, they are associated with distributed data processing using the concurrent invocations. We claim that the current serverless computing environments can support dynamic applications in parallel when a partitioned task is executable on a small function instance. We present results of throughput, network bandwidth, a file I/O and compute performance regarding the concurrent invocations. We deployed a series of functions for distributed data processing to address the elasticity and then demonstrated the differences between serverless computing and virtual machines for cost efficiency and resource utilization.

## Problem 


## Proposal
The paper evaluates serverless computing environments invoking functions in parallel to demonstrate the performance and throughput of serverless computing for distributed data processing. It compares the performance of CPU, memory, and disk intensive functions running in between a sequential and a concurrent invocation which helps understanding performance bottlenecks and function behaviors on serverless computing environments. It also measures the throughput of a set of event handlers including HTTP, database and storage which may indicate a maximum size of dequeuing event messages because functions are triggered by these common handlers supported by each serverless provider. Continuous development and integration are tested with source code changes and function configuration changes e.g. timeout value and memory size while concurrent functions are running. The rest contains comparisons between IaaS and FaaS using experiments on big data and deep learning applications and the latest features offered by each serverless computing environment from Amazon Lambda, Microsoft Azure Functions, Google Functions, and IBM OpenWhisk.

## Evaluation
Serverless computing environments were evaluated on the throughput of concurrent invocation, CPUs, response time for dynamic workload, runtime overhead, and a temporary directory I/O performance. The evaluation also compares cost-effectiveness, event
trigger throughput, and features using a set of functions written by supported runtimes e.g. nodeJS, Python, Java, and C#.

## Conclusion
Results show that the elasticity of Amazon Lambda exceeds others regarding CPU performance, network bandwidth, and I/O throughput when concurrent function invocations are made for dynamic workloads. Overall, serverless computing is able to scale relatively well to perform distributed data processing if a divided task is small enough to execute on a function instance with 1.5GB to 3GB memory limit and 5 to 10 minute execution time limit. It also indicates that serverless computing would be more cost-effective than processing on traditional virtual machines because of the almost zero delay on boot up new instances for additional function invocations and a charging model only for the execution time of functions instead of paying for idle time of machines.
