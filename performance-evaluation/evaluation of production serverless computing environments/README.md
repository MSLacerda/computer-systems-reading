# **[Evaluation of Production Serverless Computing Environments](http://dsc.soic.indiana.edu/publications/Evaluation_of_Production_Serverless_Computing_Environments.pdf)**

## Abstract
Serverless computing provides a small runtime container to execute lines of codes without infrastructure management which is similar to Platform as a Service (PaaS) but a functional level. Amazon started the event-driven compute named Lambda functions in 2014 with a 25 concurrent limitation, but it now supports at least a thousand of concurrent invocation to process event messages generated by resources like databases, storage and system logs. Other providers, i.e., Google, Microsoft, and IBM offer a dynamic scaling manager to handle parallel requests of stateless functions in which additional containers are provisioning on new compute nodes for distribution. However, while functions are often developed for microservices and lightweight workload, they are associated with distributed data processing using the concurrent invocations. We claim that the current serverless computing environments can support dynamic applications in parallel when a partitioned task is executable on a small function instance. We present results of throughput, network bandwidth, a file I/O and compute performance regarding the concurrent invocations. We deployed a series of functions for distributed data processing to address the elasticity and then demonstrated the differences between serverless computing and virtual machines for cost efficiency and resource utilization.

## Problem 
Serverless computing is a cloud computing paradigm or a cloud service that enables stateless functions on containers with small resource allocation. Containers are more lightweight than virtual machines, which means that we can start and destroy them more quickly too, once virtual machines need time to scale with system settings i.e. an instance type, a base image, a network configuration, and a storage option, while containers only need to load its container image. That's only one of the container's advantages against virtual machines. We already know that virtual machines on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) given its current popularity are a viable option, but does the containers on Function as a Service (FaaS) viable too? Even better, as argued at paper's abstract, does the current serverless computing environments able to support dynamic applications in parallel when a partitioned task is executable on a small function instance?

## Proposal
The paper evaluates serverless computing environments invoking functions in parallel to demonstrate the performance and throughput of serverless computing for distributed data processing. It compares the performance of CPU, memory, and disk intensive functions running in between a sequential and a concurrent invocation which helps understanding performance bottlenecks and function behaviors on serverless computing environments. It also measures the throughput of a set of event handlers including HTTP, database and storage which may indicate a maximum size of dequeuing event messages because functions are triggered by these common handlers supported by each serverless provider. Continuous development and integration are tested with source code changes and function configuration changes e.g. timeout value and memory size while concurrent functions are running. The rest contains comparisons between IaaS and FaaS using experiments on big data and deep learning applications and the latest features offered by each serverless computing environment from Amazon Lambda, Microsoft Azure Functions, Google Functions, and IBM OpenWhisk.

## Evaluation
Serverless computing environments were evaluated on the throughput of concurrent invocation, CPUs, response time for dynamic workload, runtime overhead, and a temporary directory I/O performance. The evaluation also compares cost-effectiveness, event
trigger throughput, and features using a set of functions written by supported runtimes e.g. nodeJS, Python, Java, and C#.

## Results

## Conclusion
The paper claim that the current serverless computing environments are able to support dynamic applications in parallel as said at abstract and asked in problems. It concludes that serverless computing functions are able to process distributed data applications by quickly provisioning additional compute resources on multiple containers.  

Results show that the elasticity of Amazon Lambda exceeds others regarding CPU performance, network bandwidth, and I/O throughput when concurrent function invocations are made for dynamic workloads. Overall, serverless computing is able to scale relatively well to perform distributed data processing if a divided task is small enough to execute on a function instance with 1.5GB to 3GB memory limit and 5 to 10 minute execution time limit. 

It also indicates that serverless computing would be more cost-effective than processing on traditional virtual machines because of the almost zero delay on boot up new instances for additional function invocations and a charging model only for the execution time of functions instead of paying for idle time of machines.
